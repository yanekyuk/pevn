## PEVN Stack

This is a template for a pure javascript system. It makes use of 2 different applications seperated as `server` and `client`. The `server` is an _express.js_ server which uses _sequelize_ as ORM. The `client` is a _Vue.js_ single-page application but it fakes the url endpoints to seem not like one.
