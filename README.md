## PEVN Stack

This is a template for a pure javascript system. It makes use of 2 different applications seperated as `server` and `client`. The `server` is an _express.js_ server which uses _sequelize_ as ORM. The `client` is a _Vue.js_ single-page application but it fakes the url endpoints to seem not like one.

## Security

I'm sure this is not secure at all. I try the patch the vulnerabilities on the go, but I am no expert. If you find any vulnerabilities you can send me an email via [yanekyuksel@gmail.com](mailto:yanekyuksel@gmail.com) or make a push request.
